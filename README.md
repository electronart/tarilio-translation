## Translating

Use our FREE Language File Editor

Download from here: [(https://tarilio.com/product/language-file-editor/)](https://tarilio.com/product/language-file-editor/)

The Help file includes instructions for translation.  

Update 25 October 2025: Language File Editor is now an open source project: [https://github.com/electronart/Language_File_Editor](https://github.com/electronart/Language_File_Editor) 

Update 4 August 2025: New version of Language File Editor released. 
1) The text displayed on the left  (original English word(s)) is now copied to the clipboard when the 'next' button is pressed. 
2) User can also 'click' on the original English word(s) label to copy to clipboard, but note - the label doesnt show that it is selected.

You will then be able to paste the English text into a translation app. Remove the brackets [] from around the text before translation. 
Paste back the translated text into the right hand column, to replace the English text. 

Update 30 July 2025: There are known issues with the Language File Editor.
1) The text displayed on the left  (original English word(s)) are not copyable. 
2) The text displayed on the left  (original English word(s)) - on a few rows - the text is longer than the label width.

If you are creating a new language translation file, a workaround for the issues above is to initially open the (renamed)
en-GB.lang file from the File menu instead of the template.lang file.
You will then be able to copy the text from the right hand column to paste the English text into a translation app.
Remove the brackets [] from around the text before translation. 
Paste back the translated text into the right hand column, to replace the English text.


## Staying up-to-date

Merge conflicts can happen if you're translating an outdated version of the template.lang file, part of which might have been translated by someone else. 

To prevent this, download and install the latest release of eSearch Pro right before you translate. The template.lang file can be found under C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\eSearch\i18n\

Download from here: https://dtsearch.co.uk/news/product/esearch-pro/

Alternatively fork the esearch project itself: https://github.com/electronart/esearch-project/tree/master/eSearch/i18n

## Update 24 Sep 2025

Currently eSearch project ships with partially translated files only.

Languages in progress will be posted in this repo and the status published below.

All are provided AS-IS. They may have been translated using AI Tools without assistance of a professional human translator.
